# bloodmanagementphp

Author: Nikhil Sardana

This is a simple (dummy) Web Application based on HTML,PHP and MySQL for simulating a blood bank management system.

=>The website contains a forum for discussion without registering.

=>Login and register pages are provided.

=>The passwords are stored in the form of their md5 sums (hashes) instead of plain text.

=>The project also contains a "mysql commands required.txt" file that contains the sql commands required to create the required database on the server to store and retrieve information. It assumes both the username and password to be "root", though these values must be changed according to the usage of the application.
